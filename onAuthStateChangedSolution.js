This solution addresses the issue by adding an intermediary state variable that the app actively manages. This allows the app to update UI elements while waiting for Firebase to confirm the authentication state changes, which makes the process much more reliable. This is important for improving the overall user experience, especially in situations where authentication is critical.

```javascript
// onAuthStateChangedSolution.js
let user = null;
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((firebaseUser) => {
  // Update the app's state variable 'user' with the Firebase user
  user = firebaseUser; 
  // Update the UI based on the updated 'user' state.
  updateUI(user);
});

function updateUI(user) {
  // Update UI elements based on the current value of the user variable
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in
    console.log('User is signed in', user.uid);
  } else {
    // User is signed out
    console.log('User is signed out');
  }
}
```
